Introduction to Sustainable Developments Concepts and Theory
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This session introduces some of the core concepts, issues and frameworks of sustainable development. We will emphasize ways in which planners think about sustainability in light of economic and environmental challenges and explore applications to practicum projects.

Concepts and Theory: Brownfields and Neighborhood Development
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
We will explore sustainable development as it applies to the neighborhood or local scale in this session. Focusing on brownfields and community economic development, we will examine specific approaches to advancing sustainability in a community planning setting. This session will also consider different perspectives on business development in immigrant communities.

Brownfields, Economic Base Analysis, and Indicators
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Part II of the class represents the first phase of our planning work during which key tools and analytical approaches are presented to support an assessment of existing conditions. A full day field trip is scheduled, which begins the research and assessment activities on existing conditions. This part concludes with in-class presentations of summary findings and their integration into a proposed agenda for the class plan.  
  
This class will review several tools used for environmental and economic analysis of an area. Issues and data sources for identifying brownfield sites and other environmental risks are presented along with a simple framework for conducting an economic base analysis. We will also consider the use of indicators to measure and track sustainability.

Research Methods: Waste Streams/Emissions and Industry and Cluster Analysis
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
How do planners, citizens, and other stakeholders access information about pollution and other environmental health issues in their communities? How do they better understand the industrial activities occurring around them? This session will review some methods for acquiring and interpreting this information.

Presentation on Preliminary Findings (Team 1)
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
The goals for this and the next session are threefold: (1) get each team to consolidate its analysis and interpret its meaning for the project; (2) vet and refine each team's analysis, ideas and proposals; and (3) gain feedback on the presentation organization, clarity and ways to enhance it. One project team will have 30 to 40 minutes to present their existing conditions findings, implications for the project and the initial proposals for the plan focus and agenda. The second half of the class will be used to discuss the analysis and findings and offer feedback prior to the client meeting.

Technology Transfer, Green Design, and Industrial Ecology
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Technology is an important vehicle for advancing both economic development and environmental goals. New technologies are platforms for the development of new products and industries that generate jobs, wealth and income, and they can produce significant environmental improvements. In many cases, the challenge is not finding technologies but expanding the use of existing technologies that can improve environment and business performance but which face barriers to adoption by local firms, organizations and households. This session presents frameworks and specific polices and practices used to advance the commercialization of technologies by firms and development projects, with a special emphasis on the adoption of environmentally sustainable technology.

Small Business Development and Land Use Planning
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Small business development and land-use regulation are two critical areas of planning practice that shape the character of local communities and neighborhoods. This class provides an overview of the key issues and primary interventions used to shape the type of businesses and land uses developed within a community and their economic and environmental outcomes. Special attention is paid to two emerging themes: (1) reversing the environmental and economic consequences of sprawl; and (2) leveraging growth and neighborhood benefits from small firms. We will also consider the inter-relationship of these two practice areas.
